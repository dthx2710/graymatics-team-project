# Testing

## Cypress
We are using Cypress for our testing. Cypress is a powerful front-end testing framework that allows us to test the front-end of our application. We are using Cypress because it is easy to use and allows us to test the front-end of our application. For this project we are using Cypress version 6.2.1.

We have created several End to End (e2e) unit tests for testing development purposes. You can find them under the `gray-app/cypress/e2e` folder. These tests are not meant to be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline. They are meant to be run locally to test the functionality of the application. Please feel free to add more tests to this folder.

For more information on Cypress, please visit their website: https://www.cypress.io/. Documentation for Cypress can be found here: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell.
